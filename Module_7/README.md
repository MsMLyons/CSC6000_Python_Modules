Write a Python program that receives information about a lottery game based on the player guessing k numbers out of n possible numbers. Assume that the game consists of the players betting on k numbers, the lottery agent randomly draws k numbers, and the player wins big if hitting all k drawn numbers, and wins little if hitting k-1 drawn numbers.

● Your program should ask the users the values of n and k;

○ Then your program should compute:

● the probability of winning big (hitting all k drawn numbers) and

● the probability of winning little (hitting k-1 drawn numbers).
