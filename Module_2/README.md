Instructions
Write a Python program that:

○ Asks the user a number as a string (to set a maximum number of digits in your program is ok);

○ Your program should ask which is the base (an Integer from 2 to 16);

○ With that information, your program should compute the binary and decimal representations of the number, then print it out as a string

○ For example, if the user enters: FA and 16, your program should print out:

-- "FA in base 16 is: 250 in base 10 and 11111010 in base 2"

○ If the user enters: 34 and 5, your program should print:

-- "34 in base 5 is: 19 in base 10 and 10011 in base 2"
