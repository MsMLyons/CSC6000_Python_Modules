Fifth Coding Project - Week 5 - P#5
Instructions
Write a Python program to print Pascal's Triangle.

Your program should ask the user the number of lines (use a limit from 4 to 8 lines) of the Pascal's Triangle.
Your program should have a function that computes the binomial coefficient of n and k, and this function should be used to find the values of the cells of the Pascal's Triangle.
The great challenge of this program is the output formatting which requires you to assemble the lines with the proper space.
