Instructions
Write a Python program that:

1. Asks the user its name, its age, and the current year;
2. Then, your program should print out a message as:
    "Dear <name>, you were born either in <year1> or <year2>"

For example, if the user enters: Arnold Schwarzenegger, 75, and 2023, your program should prints out:
