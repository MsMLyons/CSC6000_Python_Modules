# Solving Arrangements of Multisets

# Write a Python program to compute Arrangements of Multisets that:

# ○ Asks the user a number of subsets (no smaller than 3, no greater than 8);

# ■ j

# ○ Asks the user the size of each subset (from 1 to 5);

# ■ mi        with i going from 1 to j

# ○ Asks the user the total number of the arrangement (a number smaller than the sum of sizes of the subsets - n)

# ■ k

# ○ Then, it computes and prints the number of arrangements of k elements out of n, considering the subsets of size mi;
